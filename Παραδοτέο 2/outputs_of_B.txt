Our Chinese culture celebrates the dragon boat festival today to ensure the safety and prosperity of all involved. May you also have a good time, as my thoughts are with you. We appreciate your message to convey our thanks to the doctor for sharing our thoughts as they prepare for their next contract check. I was notified to view the sanctioned message. The professor sent me a message to show me this a few days ago. The professor's complete backing has been greatly appreciated for publishing our Springer proceedings.

During our last discussion, I shared with him the news of the new submission we had been waiting for last autumn, but the changes were unclear as they did not include full feedback from the reviewer or editor. Despite the delay and reduced communication, the team made efforts to produce papers and collaborate effectively. The acceptance and efforts made until the Springer link finally arrived last week should be acknowledged by everyone. Kindly inform me if the doctor has time to revise the acknowledgments section before resending. Is it possible that I didn't witness the final segment or was I missing something? I'm sorry if this appears. In the end, we must ensure that everyone is secure and mark the occasion with potent coffee and future objectives.

Today is our Dragon Boat Festival. In Chinese culture, we celebrate this with everything safe and beautiful in our lives. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, as is my deepest wish. Thank you for your report showing our words to the doctor, as well as his next contractual check-up, for all of us. I received this message so I could see the approved report. Actually, I got a text from the professor to show me this a few days ago. I really appreciate the professor's full support in our Springer publication.

During our last discussion, I told him about a new submission -- the one we had been waiting for since last fall, but the update was confusing because it didn't include full feedback from a reviewer or even an editor. Anyway, I trust that the team, even if a little late and less communicative in the last few days, has really tried its best in terms of paper and cooperation. I think we should all be grateful, I mean all of us, for accepting and trying until the Springer connection finally came through last week. Also, please remind me if the doctor is still planning to edit the acknowledgements section before sending it again. Since I haven't seen the final part yet, or maybe I missed it, I'm sorry if I did. All in all, let's make sure everyone is safe and celebrate the results with strong coffee and future goals.

During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission we were waiting for since last autumn, but it was confusing as it did not include the full feedback from reviewer or editor. I believe the team tried their best for paper and cooperation despite delay and less communication recently. We should be thankful for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came last week, I think. If the doctor still plans for the acknowledgments section to be edited before he sends again, please remind me. I apologize if I missed that part final because I didn't see it yet. Let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with coffee and targets.
